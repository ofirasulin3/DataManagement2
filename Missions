1. TODO: add support for parameters for GET requests.

2. TODO: add support for Post request without Authorization field, if needed

3. TODO: understand how to implement dynamic pages with parser

4. TODO: understand and implement async server ## Most important(look at tips)
    make the read from mime.json await (needs to be non-blocking)

5. update the error handling to include headers
   and update all headers to include content/len

6. check for /users in a post request

7. make sure no client can access the users.db file and the config.py file.

8. pass on the instructions again


done:

1. choose the right package for parsing the Mime json file and write code for extracting right content type
2. extract the port number from the config.py (open the file to a string, then take the first line, split by : and take the second and finished.)
3. add support for Post + Delete requests
   Post + Delete requests check for admin,
4. set up a timer through each connection with timeout parameter  (open timer when accepting a conncetion and change the while true to while timeout<=timeout(param)
5. create DB API for users:
   (insert(for post) + delete + check if exists )
   call user_exists before calling to delete or checkIfValid
