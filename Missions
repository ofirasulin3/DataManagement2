Question for rani/Piazza:
1. is it needed to support Post/GET request without Authorization field?
2. what do we need to do with query string?
3. Is the template parser structure is good? (show him the function),
   do we need to return something?

1. TODO: add support for Post request without Authorization field, if needed

2. TODO: understand and implement async server ## Most important(look at tips)
    make the read from mime.json await (needs to be non-blocking)

3. update the error handling to include headers
   and update all headers to include content/len

4. make sure no client can access the users.db file and the config.py file.

5. pass on the instructions again


done:

1. choose the right package for parsing the Mime json file and write code for extracting right content type
2. extract the port number from the config.py (open the file to a string, then take the first line, split by : and take the second and finished.)
3. add support for Post + Delete requests
   Post + Delete requests check for admin,
4. set up a timer through each connection with timeout parameter  (open timer when accepting a conncetion and change the while true to while timeout<=timeout(param)
5. create DB API for users:
   (insert(for post) + delete + check if exists )
   call user_exists before calling to delete or checkIfValid
6. understand how to implement dynamic pages with parser
7. in GET dp requests, check for valid users
8. check for /users in a post request
9. for GET requests, support for getting params
